            <ul>
                <li><b>stain - rapid GUI development</b> - I will show you a project I've been working on for a 
                    past half year or so. It's a node.js library for developing GUI applications (think electron) 
                    which happens to be partly implemented in rust (mostly because it's using webrender under the 
                    hood). Apart from some intro & showcase, I'd like to talk a bit about original design and why 
                    it didn't work and what we've decided to rather go with instead. (Kamil)</li>
